### How to Play

Grab on to the platform and tilt it using your mouse in order to keep Mr. Zamansky from riding off either end and leaving for Hunter. The longer you can keep Mr. Z safely on his bike and away from what lies below him, the better. 

All code was developed in JavaScript using Scalable Vector Graphics. Biker movements are written to accurately simulate the physical world.
